<div style="text-align:center">

Hierarchies are a must for reading lists, so: <br/><br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline">bold and underlined = my absolute favorites</span> <br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold">bold = my favorites</span> <br/>

<span style="color:#4a4aa8">blue = haven't read yet, but looks wonderfully appealing</span> <br/>
