*Pondering my place in the world.*

I painted a sunrise this morning<br>
as mournful as yesterday<br>
as hopeful as tomorrow<br>
when the sky was soft and rosy<br>
like an angel’s kiss<br>
The sunrise was impeccable this morning<br>
but now that I’ve painted it<br>
it’s suddenly<br>
frustratingly imperfect<br>
the mountains, fading<br>
the ocean, receding and never returning<br>
the sky, dappled with gray<br>
I can’t admire the birds flying, carefree<br>
or the tops of the trees swayed by the wind<br>
or the music and heartfelt laughter<br>
or the ringing of church bells from afar<br>
when I see the severed stem of an unhappy flower plucked by a traveler<br>
and a twisted lie woven among branches<br>
and a crushed dream<br>
exhausted from begging for acceptance<br>
dying beneath the willows<br>
and my own fear of reality not being as picturesque as it seemed<br>
Maybe one day I’ll paint myself in the picture<br>
but for now I’ll stay out of the frame<br>
for now I’ll keep away and not disturb<br>
the ocean’s ethereal dance with the sand<br>
and the celestial embrace of the quiet dawn<br>
maybe one day I’ll love the flowers growing by the thousands<br>
never wondering why they exist<br>
but we smile at them anyway<br>
for now I’ll sit in silence, alone<br>
and count brushstrokes until I can fit<br>
myself in the frame<br>
and maybe then<br>
I can be free from numbers<br>
