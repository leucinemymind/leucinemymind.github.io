> We may not always see eye to eye, but we can try to see heart to heart.

All too often we forget that the world is not a fair playing field. Society is not purely a meritocracy. Not everyone has access to the same resources and opportunities, but we make it work. We find some way to make it work despite the challenges we face daily, whether that’s external pressures, internal discontent, or both. We laugh and cry through the hard times, share a smile during the good times, and our hands and hearts reach out beyond the imaginary lines between countries. 

These recent years have been a controversial few, but no matter what side you happen to be on, the one thing that holds us all together is community. Personally, I have had the privilege to be surrounded by passionate, supportive young women in a peaceful community under clear skies, soon to be leading a workshop and uplifting girls who want to learn to code. Unfortunately, not everyone has this privilege. Families are being torn apart all around the world, and we watch the news, helpless because there is not an actionable plan in sight. Girls are barred from classrooms and public spaces. When looking at it that way, it seems almost wrong to take advantage of the opportunities we're presented with daily, but we're all just doing our best with what we have, and there is nothing more than we can do except offer empathy and grace. We offer others respect, not pity, because they have worked hard to get to where they are.

As our local chapter prepares for another year of Girls Who Code, the only thing I am hoping for from my friends is that we remember why we code, not just what we code. The GWC sisterhood is a truly special bond, and I am inspired every day by the women around the world sharing their expertise in technology. We code to come up with solutions to real-world problems, to make sense of the technology that is so prevalent in our lives. We code to uplift others, for all the girls whose dreams are out of reach, to build community with our sisters across generations and across the globe. We don’t code simply for the sake of coding or filling up space on our résumés. GWC is *so* much more than just writing lines in an IDE.

Whether you’re busy working on an activist website, a game, a simulation, or a mathematical model, your enthusiasm and your project matter. Never mind its degree of complexity. Even if you don’t think it’s good enough, even if you don’t think it’s reaching far enough - your project is important and the world needs it. And with this coming year, we remember that there are so many people, so many young women just like us in the world would do anything for the plethora of opportunities that define our normal.

This coming 2025-26 school year, as we launch new projects and welcome new faces, let’s not forget that our code carries purpose beyond the screen. For every girl who dreams of coding but can’t yet access a laptop or a classroom, we will write something meaningful. Let’s code not just for pleasure, but for a more connected, more equitable world.
