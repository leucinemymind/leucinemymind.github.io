This isn’t my typical post, but I’ve committed to sharing my authentic experience, so today we’re talking about something a little less techy and a little more big-picture.

If this is the first post of mine you’ve read, welcome! I’m Emily, a rising junior from the US. I’m a bookworm, a bunny mom, a not-professional dancer and singer, an upcoming club head at my school’s Girls Who Code chapter, and, if all goes well in the future, an aspiring biologist. (Here that term is being used very broadly because I am indecisive, and if I had my way, I would go to school to become a public health molecular mathematical computational structural evolutionary marine physical chemical microbiologist with some education on the side, which, presumably, does not exist.) I am fifteen going on sixteen, and it is time to think. (Did I also mention I’m a performer who enjoys *The Sound of Music* a bit too much?)

I’ve had the pleasure to talk with lots of wonderful scientists and engineers (and one lovely architect!) about their careers. Each of them has given me the exact same advice: Don’t wait until you know everything. I clearly do not know everything. I’m just an ordinary fifteen-year-old girl trying to use my resources wisely and become a resource for people who are at the beginning of their LaTeX journey.

So here I am trying to spread knowledge about LaTeX through nothing other than a LaTeX workshop open to anyone in the upper school! Yes, the thought of educating others on a tool that I haven’t fully mastered yet does intimidate me, but theoretically, by the time I became well-versed in the usage of every package and feature, developers would have published completely new packages. I love LaTeX more than I love to avoid public speaking, and I really do believe it has the potential to be as popular of a resource for high school students as it is for college students if they start their journey right - with patience, with passion, and with too much time on their hands to sit in front of a computer and try not to crash before their software does.

I’m incredibly fortunate to have the support of my computer science teacher, my marine biology teacher, and the enthusiastic, ambitious, brilliant young ladies who are *the* Girls Who Code, and I hope we can all come together to make this workshop a reality next year. 

See you all very soon!
