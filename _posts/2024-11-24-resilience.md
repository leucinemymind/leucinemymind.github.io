*About a week ago, I visited a lovely place where ecosystems weave together seamlessly that was unfortunately devastated by natural disaster. These were my thoughts.*

There, above the leaves, <br>
the heaven-born stars, <br>
a splatter of white against an ebony sky <br>
carry promises from an era <br>
too long ago to remember. Healing, <br>
concealed within a smooth stone bed <br>
embraced by the gentle ocean, <br>
caressed by the water’s tender palms, <br>
is the land so carefully preserved,<br>
the place that repairs itself, silent, enduring.
<br> If a tree falls in a forest - <br>
or rather, when a tree falls in a forest - <br>
and no one is there to hear it, <br>
only it knows its own destiny, <br>
a terrifying secret, its subtle features <br>
a testament to its distress. They praise <br>
the earthly angels, the saints, the missionaries
<br> while burning down communities, <br>
cheering for the downfall of their own kin. 
<br>
They hold torches to the earth <br>
while commending her strength, <br>
how her children withstand the burning <br>
as they toss the blazing embers at her feet, <br>
fleeing in shame, covering their footsteps. <br>
She endures quietly. A challenge? Perhaps. <br>
Perhaps not. <br>
Silence is ambiguous <br>
But perhaps she has decided that 
ambiguity <br>
is all we deserve. <br>
