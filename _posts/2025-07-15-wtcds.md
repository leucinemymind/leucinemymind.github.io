> For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet fishing village. Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead, locals immediately suspect her. <br/><br/> But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world—until the unthinkable happens. <br/><br/> In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps. <br/><br/> The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural histories of its wild creatures. <br/><br/> —Goodreads on **Where the Crawdads Sing**

This beautiful novel remains my favorite of all time, a love story between two budding biologists. Kya Clark, a little girl growing up in the marsh, learns the non-traditional way, yet in the most primitive way possible - by simple observation. Tate Walker, an ambitious young boy who wants to make something of himself, finds a position in academia. They both grow up to become prominent biologists despite taking separate paths. I’m not usually a fan of romance stories, but the stark contrast between Kya and Tate’s upbringings - and their subsequent character development - has always fascinated me as a reader.

Let’s talk about it.

## Kya, the innocent survivalist

Imagine for a moment that you are a helpless child and everyone decides to leave you. Everyone in your family, everyone you’ve ever known - except for your abusive father whose moods are unpredictable. That’s essentially the story of Catherine “Kya” Clark’s life - the youngest child who is forced to become an adult when she is just seven years old.

In modern media, the youngest children are portrayed as the family favorite, the one who has no responsibility. Not Kya. Perhaps when she was younger, she might have been, but now that everybody’s gone and she’s left on her own, she has to grow up. Quickly.

Her first few days are all about trial and error: she goes to the supermarket by herself, learns to cook (emphasis on the *trial* part here), and learns to fill up her father’s fishing boat with gas. She lives on the marsh, away from the other children, so it’s no surprise that she’s an outcast. Later, her father also leaves.

While she’s by herself, though, she’s not fully alone. She seeks refuge in nature, spending her days observing the gulls and the fireflies and getting her hands on whatever books she can to learn more about the world around her. She’s a naturally curious soul, though she chooses to pursue her education in an unconventional way - through careful observation of her surroundings. 

## Tate, the determined academic

Tate comes from humble beginnings as well. He lives alone with his father, since his sister and mother died in a car accident. Unlike Kya, he attends school and has access to more traditional forms of education, but he still shares her fascination with the natural world.

As a boy, he meets Kya in the marsh and recognizes her curiosity and intelligence. Instead of treating her like an outsider, he teaches her how to read and write. His mentorship is one of the few bridges between Kya and the rest of society. There is a degree of gentleness to him when he’s with Kya, a kind of gentleness that he seems to be pressured to hide around the rest of society.

Tate is driven not by pure ambition, but by a deep respect for the world around him. He eventually pursues higher education, studying science formally and building a life in academia. Yet despite all the knowledge he gains, he never loses sight of where he came from or of Kya, his unlikely lover.

I find it interesting that Tate and Kya represent two different ways of acquiring knowledge - one grounded in structured education, and the other in raw experience and instinct - and the differences between society and nature, yet they are so similar in so many ways. And at the end, though Tate chooses to leave the marsh to pursue formal education, it never fully leaves him - just as Kya, though she isolates herself, never truly stops longing for connection. Their personalities overlap just enough for them to fall deeply in love.

## Kya’s intriguing dichotomy…or lack thereof

After my first read about two years ago, it seemed to me that Kya never fully grew up - at least not in the traditional sense. In many ways, her emotional depth and self-sufficiency are indicators of a different kind of maturity. And yes, this sounds counterintuitive, because she’s been fending for herself for years, but while she did learn to survive in the wild, she never learned to survive in society. When she’s in her natural habitat (literally), she’s a pensive, observant young woman, but when she’s around people, she’s rather clueless.

But does a person need both natural survival skills and social skills to be considered mature? Surely there are more skills to be acquired than those. What even is maturity, then? A combination of select types of intelligence? Are there many kinds of maturity, and is each kind acceptable on its own? How is it obtained? Does it come naturally to you as you grow up, or do you have to be around people to be completely mature? Does it come from the people around you? Kya isn’t around too many people at the same time and spends a good amount of her childhood and young adulthood alone, but she does build relationships with many characters in the book - Tate, Jumpin’, Mabel, and at some point, even the grocery store clerk.

I fell down a bit of a rabbit hole here, but it reminded me of a conversation I had with my friend about nature vs. nurture just a year ago. Her brother, she said, immediately started screaming after he was born. (Understandable.) Her sister was born the complete opposite - quiet as a mouse, even as a baby.

Kya obviously learned survival skills on her own, but that leads to another question: how much did the people around Kya influence her, if at all? Her personality, I would argue, remains mostly unchanged. Additionally, under her circumstances, nature *is* nurture, so there is hardly any point in separating the two. Which then led me to think about how much of what we think and what we believe is due to social construct.

I can’t fully answer these questions (yes, they are, as they say, being left as an exercise to the reader) without doing an in-depth analysis that will possibly take me days, but one fact does remain: maturity is subjective. After all, we are measuring the *extent* to which Kya is considered a mature individual, and we know all too well that when someone asks you to evaluate the extent to which something affects another, we’re speaking subjectively. (Shoutout to my middle school English teacher who would always give that as the prompt.) And if you do choose to answer these questions, please tell me your thoughts!

In a way, Kya is a reflection of the natural world. Largely untouched by societal influences, she accepts the lessons that nature has taught her. Her discovery of the “horrors” of the natural world, such as a female insect feeding on her partner, challenges the assumption that what is natural must be inherently moral and separates biology from morality.

## Conclusion

I just wrote enough content to fill an English essay without having it assigned to me! Sadly, I don’t get points for this. But it was fun to review this book, especially since Tate and Kya’s relationship made me rethink my stance on romance novels.

Anyway, if you have the time, I would definitely recommend giving *Where the Crawdads Sing* a read. It is a remarkable book that holds a mirror to the earth in its most natural form.

Overall, this book makes you think about the fine line between nature and society, if it exists at all. We *could* imitate animals - consume our spouses, maybe (do *not* quote me on this). But what’s stopping us? Morals. Why do we care? Because we have a conscience. What is a conscience? I can’t answer that - please consult your local philosopher :)

We as a society tend to consider ourselves separate from nature, and I would go so far as to say we consider ourselves above nature, but *Where the Crawdads Sing* reminds us that deep down, we are still a part of it, and it is still a part of us.
