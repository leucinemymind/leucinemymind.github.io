You found my little internet corner! Welcome!

I'm Emily, a rising junior in high school and professional Googler of things I thought I already knew. I share my real (read: mildly disastrous) experiences learning tools like LaTeX, Git, and whatever the tech world throws at me. I love biology, especially molecular biophysics, programming, the performing arts, the ocean, Bo Burnham's music, Nerdfighteria, and reading a good book on the beach.

Follow my learning journey! :)
