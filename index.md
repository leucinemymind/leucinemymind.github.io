> "But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness, I want sin." <br/> ---Aldous Huxley, **Brave New World**r

You found my little internet corner! Welcome!

I'm Emily, a rising junior in high school and professional Googler of things I thought I already knew. I share my real (read: mildly disastrous) experiences learning whatever the world decides to throw at me. I love biology, especially biophysics/biochemistry, programming, the performing arts, the ocean, Bo Burnham's music, Nerdfighteria, and reading a good [book](/books/) on the beach.

My past endeavors:
- Introductory biochemistry research focusing on the thermodynamics of protein folding
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eJ4oZFWRLk8" style="color:#ffffff">Python</a> peer tutoring
- Creating a comprehensive, concise LaTeX tutorial for students
- Shows, a lot of them

What I'm currently up to:
- Developing my artistic side (i.e. even more shows!)
- Planning a school-wide LaTeX workshop
- Prepping session content for Girls Who Code
- Developing my skills (and trying to find my niche) with biochemistry pre-college and a virtual clinical internship
- An independent computational biology project that will not yet be revealed :)
