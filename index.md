You found my little internet corner! Welcome!

I'm Emily, a rising junior in high school and professional Googler of things I thought I already knew. I share my real (read: mildly disastrous) experiences learning whatever the tech world throws at me. I love biology, especially biophysics/biochemistry, programming, the performing arts, the ocean, Bo Burnham's music, Nerdfighteria, and reading a good book on the beach.

I lead my local chapter of Girls Who Code, taking an inclusive, beginner-friendly approach to educating and empowering young women, as well as encouraging them to immerse themselves in an increasingly technology-centered world and apply the skills they learn to develop personal projects. I aspire to pursue a career in academia or medicine after graduating from university.

My past endeavors:
- Introductory biochemistry research focusing on the thermodynamics of protein folding
- Python peer tutoring
- Creating a comprehensive, concise LaTeX tutorial for students

What I'm currently up to:
- Leading a school-wide LaTeX workshop
- Planning session content for Girls Who Code
- Developing my skills (and trying to find my niche) with biochemistry pre-college and a virtual clinical internship
- An independent computational biology project that will not yet be revealed

Follow my learning journey! :)
