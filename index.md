Welcome to my little internet corner where we learn something new every day!

I'm Emily, a rising junior in high school and professional Googler of things I thought I already knew. I share my real (read: mildly disastrous) experiences learning tools like LaTeX, Git, and whatever the tech world throws at me. I love biology, especially molecular biophysics, programming, the performing arts, the ocean, Bo Burnham's music, Nerdfighteria, and reading a good book on the beach. I'm also obsessed with LaTeX to a slightly concerning extent, so this page is mostly a jumble of thoughts on it and its many features. No tutorials, just figuring stuff out together. Follow my journey! :)
